- Enjoy full control over your data. Receive web visibility, academic credit, and increased citation counts. A personal Dataverse collection is easy to set up, allows you to display your data on your personal website, can be branded uniquely as your research program, makes your data more discoverable to the research community, and satisfies data management plans. 
- Seamlessly manage the submission, review, and publication of data associated with published articles. Establish an unbreakable link between articles in your journal and associated data. Participate in the open data movement by using a Dataverse collection as part of your journal data policy or list of repository recommendations.
- Establish a research data management solution for your community. Federate with a growing list of Dataverse repositories worldwide for increased discoverability of your communityâ€™s data. Participate in the drive to set norms for sharing, preserving, citing, exploring, and analyzing research data.
